	<!-- 1) Have the main-page be a ladder-like stack of viewable divs and paralax back-ground divs -->

	<!-- 2) Each paralax shall be a unique video-viewpoint of my apartment. Perhaps blurred, perhaps 
	more playful, perhaps text as dialogue, perhaps me looking at my screen pretending to not hear you, 
	then leave to cook something int he kitchen, never to return. But each meaning something and 
	being relevant to its adjacent topic -->

	<!-- 3) Each paralax having a black .5-opacity overlay that clears upon mouse-over and starts video
	upon mouse-over (needs more thought and tact) -->

	<!-- 4) in-between paralaxes simple text and catchy marketing-centric self-slogans that are uniquely
	"me" and really sell why I'm just oh so simply the best. -->

	<!-- 5) those in-betweens will also link to my other pages, thus the adjacent/previous pralaxes must/should
	be relevant. (I. E., the paralax-video prior-or-post my info-div that beckons the user to click a big arrow
	that links to my "about me" page should emphasize my my multi-fasceted, creative personality with footage
	of me playing guitar. 
	For example, if I'm trying to emphasize my knowledgeon css, "he sees in css!" disappears as I start
	running down the street from the properties in the trees that see me jake {visibility: visible} and try to 
	attack jake {display: none} as I narrowly dive behind a dumpster jake {transition: ease-out} and narrowly escape
	certain doom jake {positionL sticky}.

	<!-- (this boy too ambitious!) -->
	<!-- fair criticism. -->

	<!-- 6) Link this profile with bootstrap, and give my actual portfolio page "card" properties, as cheesy as they are. -->
	<!-- (too easy/lame) -->

	<!-- 7) create a function in my own brain that bypasses all of these steps and settles for a simpler, easier, quicker
		more attainable, and overall much more employable game-plan; thus accomplishing the MVP in a timely matter, which will
		also make my being actually employable in this field that much more realistic.

	<!-- 8) Then in spare time, create a time machine and take this class as part-time but treat it as full-time so
	I actually have the time to make every project be to-the-nines! -->
